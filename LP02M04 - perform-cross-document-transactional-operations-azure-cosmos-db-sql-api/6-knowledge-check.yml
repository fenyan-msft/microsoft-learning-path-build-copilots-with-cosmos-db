  questions:
  - content: "What method parameters are required to create a transaction batch using ``container.CreateTransactionBatch()``?"
    choices:
    - content: "Partition Key"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The ``CreateTransactionalBatch()`` method has a single parameter of a partition key."
    - content: "Partition Key, List of Operations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ``CreateTransactionalBatch()`` method does not require a list of operations. These are fluent methods invoked later."
    - content: "None"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ``CreateTransactionalBatch()`` method requires at least a partition key."
  - content: "You are using the ``ItemRequestOptions`` class to configure a request to enable optimistic concurrency control. Which header should you use to check for an exact value of an ``_etag``?"
    choices:
    - content: "``SessionToken``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This header is used for session tokens."
    - content: "``IfNoneMatchEtag``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This header is used for conditional matches, not exact value matches."
    - content: "``IfMatchETag``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This header is used to match the exact value of an ETag."
  - content: "Which property of the **TransactionalBatchResponse** returns the HTTP status code indicating success or failure of the transaction?"
    choices:
    - content: "ErrorMessage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This simply returns a string, which may or may not contain a message."
    - content: "StatusCode"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This returns the HTTP status code of type **HTTPStatusCode** from the underlying communication infrastructure with specific information about why the operation may have failed."
    - content: "IsSuccessStatusCode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This only returns a boolean indicating whether the operation has succeeded."
