To create a new item, we must first create a new variable in C# code of the **Product** type.

```csharp
Product saddle = new()
{
    id = "027D0B9A-F9D9-4C96-8213-C8546C4AAE71",
    categoryId = "26C74104-40BC-4541-8EF5-9892F7F03D72",
    name = "LL Road Seat/Saddle",
    price = 27.12d,
    tags = new string[] 
    {
        "brown",
        "weathered"
    }
};
```

Let’s infer there’s already a variable of type Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.**Container** named **container**.

We can asynchronously invoke the **CreateItemAsync\<\>** method passing in the Product type and the new item variable into the constructor.

```csharp
await container.CreateItemAsync<Product>(saddle);
```

This invocation of the method creates the new item, but doesn't have any metadata about the result of the operation. Alternatively, you can store the result of the operation in a variable of type **ItemResponse\<\>**.

```csharp
ItemResponse<Product> response = await container.CreateItemAsync<Product>(saddle);

HttpStatusCode status = response.StatusCode;
double requestUnits = response.RequestCharge;

Product item = response.Resource;
```

If you're using a try-catch block, you can handle the **CosmosException** type, which includes a **StatusCode** property for HTTP status code values. There are a few common HTTP status codes that you should consider in your application code:

| Code | Title | Reason |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 400 | Bad Request | Something was wrong with the item in the body of the request |
| 403 | Forbidden | Container was likely full |
| 409 | Conflict | Item in container likely already had a matching id |
| 413 | RequestEntityTooLarge | Item exceeds max entity size |
| 429 | TooManyRequests | Current request exceeds the maximum RU/s provisioned for the container |

In this example

```csharp
try
{
    await container.CreateItemAsync<Product>(saddle);
}
catch(CosmosException ex) when (ex.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.Conflict)
{
    // Add logic to handle conflicting ids
}
catch(CosmosException ex) 
{
    // Add general exception handling logic
}
```
