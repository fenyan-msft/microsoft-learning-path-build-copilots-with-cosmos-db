To do a point read of an existing item from the container, we need two things.

First, we need the unique **id** of the item. Here, we store that id in a variable of the same name.

```csharp
string id = "027D0B9A-F9D9-4C96-8213-C8546C4AAE71";
```

Second, we need to create a variable of type **PartitionKey** with the string value for property defined as the partition key for the item we're seeking.

```csharp
string categoryId = "26C74104-40BC-4541-8EF5-9892F7F03D72";
PartitionKey partitionKey = new (categoryId);
```

Once we have both items, we can invoke the asynchronous and generic **ReadItemAsync<>** method, which returns an item of the given generic type, **Product**, in this example.

```csharp
Product saddle = await container.ReadItemAsync<Product>(id, partitionKey);
```

At this point, we can access properties of the **saddle** variable and print them to the console much like any local variable.

```csharp
string formattedName = $"New Product [${saddle}]";
Console.WriteLine(formattedName);
```
