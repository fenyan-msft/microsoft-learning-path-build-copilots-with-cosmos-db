In this module, you learned how to combine Python's powerful AI development ecosystem with the robust and scalable capabilities of Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL to create an advanced AI copilot. 

Now that you have completed this module, you can:

- Build a copilot capable of interacting with private data using Python and Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL.
- Efficiently retrieve and store vectors in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL.
- Perform silimarity searches using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL.
- Integrate data and AI models using LangChain orchestration to create intelligent and adaptable copilots.
